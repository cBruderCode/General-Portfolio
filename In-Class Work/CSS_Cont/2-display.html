    <div>
      The next area consists of a paragraph and 2 spans.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The paragraph is a <em>block</em> element.
          <ul>
            <li>Block elements consume the entire width of the parent.</li>
            <li>Blocks stack on top of one another.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The spans are each <em>inline</em> elements.
          <ul>
            <li>Each span is inside of the paragraph.</li>
            <li>Inline elements consume the exact amount of space needed.</li>
            <li>Inline elements might wrap from one line to the next.</li>
            <li>Inline elements don't stack on top of each other.</li>
            <li>Inline elements are laid out side-by-side.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Take notice of the spacing after the span and how the html is a little
          different in each case.  Spacing can be very tricky.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <span>(this is a span)</span>

      <span>
        (This is a span within the lorem ipsum text.  I want to make sure that
        this text is both long enough to wrap and distinguishable from Latin,
        so I am going on at some length in English for no other specific reason.
        I may as well throw in here that I highly recommend that students learn
        about HTML and CSS by playing around with the demos.  Add and remove
        tags, change styling, and in general try stuff out.  If you break
        anything, you can always re-download the demos.)

    <div>
      The next 4 areas are consecutive paragraphs.
      As block elements, paragraphs consume full width, and stack
      (one on top of the next).
    </div>

    <p>
      Paragraph 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Paragraph 2.
    </p>

    <p>
      Paragraph 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      Paragraph 4.
    </p>

    <div>
      The next area consists of several consecutive spans
      <em>each on new lines in the HTML file</em>.
      As inline elements, they occur side-by-side.
    </div>

    <span>Span 1.</span>
    <span>Span 2.</span>
    <span>Span 3.</span>
    <span>Span 4.</span>

    <div>
      The next area consists of several consecutive spans
      <em>all on the same line in the HTML file</em>.
      As inline elements, they occur side-by-side.  Once again,
      spacing can be tricky in HTML.
    </div>

    <span>Span 1.</span><span>Span 2.</span><span>Span 3.</span><span>Span 4.</span>

  </body>
