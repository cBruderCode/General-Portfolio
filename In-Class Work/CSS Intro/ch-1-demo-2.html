      <h2>Doge</h2>

      <p>
        Doge was the <strong>Meme of the Year</strong> in 2013 at the site
        <cite>Know Your Meme</cite>.  The meme orignates from a blog post
        about a mostly happy but generally neurotic little Shiba Inu whose
        actual name is かぼちゃん (Kabo-chan).

      <h2>Crypto</h2>

      <p>
        Cryptocurrencies can be traced back to at least 1983, though the
        most well-known cryptocurrency Bitcoin was ceated in 2009.  It's
        popularity grew of the next several years.  It is widely considered
        that 2013 was the first year Bitcoin was known to an average person
        living in the United States of America.

      <h2>Dogecoin</h2>

      <p>
        Inevitably, meme culture and cryptocurrency culture collided in 2013
        when Dogecoin was created by Jackson Palmer and (not really)
        Shibetoshi Nakamoto.  The menu structure of Dogecoin's website
        mirrors the silly language typically attributed to the Doge meme.
