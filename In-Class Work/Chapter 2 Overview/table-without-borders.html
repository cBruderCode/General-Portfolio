    <h1>Table Example</h1>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Assessment Type</th>
        <th>Grade A</th>
        <th>Grade B</th>
        <th>Grade C</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><em>Chapter</em></td>
        <td>Satisfied all but 3</td>
        <td>Satisfied all but 5</td>
        <td>Satisfied all but 7</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><em>Quiz</em></td>
        <td>Satisfied all 3</td>
        <td>Satisfied 2 of 3</td>
        <td>Satisfied 1 of 3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><em>Projects</em></td>
        <td>Completely satisfied</td>
        <td>Mostly satisfied</td>
        <td>Somewhat satisfied</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Note how the default <em>style</em> for tables is to have no borders
    around the table elements.  It can be helpful to see element borders when
    developing a table.  You can inspect <a href="table-with-borders.html">the
    same table with borders</a>, which uses a CSS styling concept we will learn
    next week.</p>
